# survey_automation_2022
This is a concept testing survey template with stim automation and tracking created in 2022.

This Decipher template was created using XML and python. It was made to address multiple researcher and programmer complaints regarding concept tracking and data integrity due to the multiple concept inputs required in the original template. 

<ul>The Problem: 
<li>Difficult to test concepts & ensure correct assignment</li>
<li>Multiple manual inputs required in programming</li>
<li>No data management standards in place</li>
</ul>

<ul>The Solution:
<li>Hidden concept check shown during pre-launch testing</li>
<li>Single input carried throughout programming</li>
<li>Concept naming & formatting standards established</li>
</ul>

The original template is included for reference as well as an example use case survey.
